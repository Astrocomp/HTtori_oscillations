Second order pressure corrections to epicyclic frequency modes in non-slender tori around neutron stars

In this notebook we provide complete formulae for calculating frequencies of axisymmetric radial and vertical epicyclic oscillations and the frequencies of non-axisymmetric oscillations oscillation and precession frequencies, as well as their convenient approximations for a fluid tori around a slowly rotating neutron star.

Based on the code written by  Straub & Sramkova 2009* with corrections made by Horák et al. 2017**.

To describe the geometry around a neutron star we use the Hartle-Thorne metric* and we use relations derived by Abramowicz et al§ 2003**

The notebook is an essential part of paper Matuszková et al. (submitted).
