In the notebook we consider fluid tori around a slowly rotating neutron star and provide complete formulae for calculating frequencies of axisymmetric radial and vertical epicyclic oscillations and the precessions frequencies (frequencies of non-axisymmetric radial and vertical epicyclic oscillations), as well as their convenient approximations.

Based on the Kerr-spacetime code initially written by Straub & Sramkova 2009 [1] with corrections and extensions made later by Fragile et al. 2016, Horák et al. 2017, and Kotrlová et al. 2020 [2-5], we extend calculations to Hartle-Thone spacetimes [A] describing the geometry around neutron stars. We also built the extension using relations derived by Abramowicz et al. 2003 and Urbancová et al. 2019 [B, C]. Important inputs for calculations concerning the properties of tori in Hartle-Thorn spacetimes are taken from Matuszkova et al. (Paper I, submitted) [D, E].
